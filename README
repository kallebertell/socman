Socman (Separation of Concerns-MAN) is a sort of turn based game.

=================================================================
WHY

This is the result of random explorative coding on how it would be like to do strict separation of concerns in game programming. This might not be the way you want to code a game, but it at least demonstrates what some separation of concerns can achieve.

The premise was that I wanted to code a game using TDD and just focus on the game rules; without having to care about how it was going to be rendered, animated or any stuff pertaining to presentation. The socman-model module models the game rules, board, actor and items (Board, Socman, Pill etc.)

The design that emerged might not feel natural at first. This is due to that I wanted to be able to animate the change of game state, but I didn't want the game to change it's actual board state before this animation had completed. I guess another way to approach it would have been to make the state changes to the board and animate those changes retroactively.

There are two implementations of the same game:
- socman-console is a console based version using ascii representation
- socman-desktop is a window based version with awesome graphics and animations (*cough*) 

One could still do more, all using the same rules from the model module, e.g.:
- an Android version 
- a web-based version based where each move requires a new http request-response to the server storing game state 
- a web-based version run completely on the client (javascript) using GWT

Feel free to fork, hack, copy and do whatever you like.
